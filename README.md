## Getting Started

Instructions below explain prerequisites and installation steps needed.

### Prerequisites

```
Python 2.7
Python OpenCV 3.4.1
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
