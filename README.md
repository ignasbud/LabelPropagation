## Getting Started

Instructions below explain prerequisites and installation steps needed.

### Prerequisites

- Python2.7
- numpy
- OpenCV3.4.1

<!--- ### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running
```
Give the example
```
And repeat
```
until finished
```
End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
